# ml-wimbledon-2019

Here we use machine learning to predict the outcome of Wimbledon 2019 matches.

The neural net is built using keras, general model architecture: 
- Number of Layers: 3. (2 Hidden Layers)
- Number of Neuros in each layer: 64->32->1
- Activation relu->relu->sigmoid

This model ended up predicting 13/15 matches correctly, including the correct final and winner.
